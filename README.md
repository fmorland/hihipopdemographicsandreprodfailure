Concerning Pedigree Data:
Hihi are of cultural significance to the Indigenous people of Aotearoa New Zealand, the Māori, and are considered a taonga (treasured) species whose whakapapa (genealogy) is intricately tied to that of Māori. For this reason, the hihi pedigree will not be made available publicly but will be made available by reasonable request on the recommendation of Ngāti Manuhiri, the iwi (tribe) that affiliates as kaitiaki (guardians) for hihi. To obtain contact details for Ngāti Manuhiri, please contact Dr Patricia Brekke at ✉ patricia.brekke@ioz.ac.uk. This process is necessary in order to maintain current permit stipulations and is in agreement with the Nagoya Protocol and NZ's treaty of partnership between the British Crown and Māori, Te Tiriti o Waitangi.
